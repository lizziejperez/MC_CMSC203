# Assignment Description
Write a Java program to encrypt and decrypt a phrase using two similar approaches, each insecure by modern standards.

The first approach is called the Caesar Cipher, and is a simple “substitution cipher” where characters in a message are replaced by a substitute character.

The second approach, due to Giovan Battista Bellaso (b 1505, d 1581), uses a key word, where each character in the word specifies the offset for the corresponding character in the message, with the key word wrapping around as needed.
