# Assignment Description
Develop a Java application that prompts for and reads two double numeric amounts that represent the Fahrenheit temperature and the wind speed.  The temperature must be between -45 and 40 inclusively. The wind speed must be between 5 and 60 inclusively. Use these two amounts in the formula below to calculate the wind chill temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
## How to calculate the New Wind Chill Index
Wind Chill (degrees Fahrenheit) = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75(V^0.16) + 0.4275T(V^0.16), where V is the Wind Speed in MPH, and T is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
