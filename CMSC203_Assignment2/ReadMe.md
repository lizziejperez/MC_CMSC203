# Assignment Description
You have decided to use a specialized toy company to purchase birthday gifts for the young children of your friends and relatives.  The toys you can choose are divided into three categories:  plushies, blocks, and books. You can add a card and/or a balloon with each gift.  Your program must display the information of the toy and the cost (including the card and the balloon), and the total amount of the order.  Your program must generate a random number between 1-100000 to serve as the order number, followed by your name as programmer.  The Toy class you are given will keep a total cost for one toy and determine if the toy is age-appropriate for the child.  You should not make any changes to the Toy class.  Assume that the user enters the name and age of the child correctly.

Note: Your program should ask for the information of the next toy and repeat the process until the user chooses not to.  You DO NOT need to keep the information of toy after displaying it to the user. 
## Requirements
- All input items and messages will use Dialog boxes.
- Use a Dialog box to display the welcome message.  
- Ask for the name of the child.
- Ask for the age of the child.
- Ask for the toy choice and validate the input choice.
- Print out a message if the toy is not age appropriate and ask if the user wants to cancel that toy request.  
- If the user replies "yes", repeat the steps for the name, age, and toy choice.  If the user replies "no", process the toy requested.  
- Ask if a card or balloon should be added to the gift.
- Display the name, age and the total for gift.
- Ask if another gift is desired. If yes, repeat the steps starting with the name of the child. If no, display on the console the total amount of the order, a random five-digit order number, and the programmer name.
